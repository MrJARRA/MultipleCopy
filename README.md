# MultipleCopy
   
   sometimes you need to make changes in component  at mode playing, but the problem you 
   can't save these changes at  mode playing, so the solution is to copy component but you 
   can't copy more than one component.
   
   these tools give you the Possibility to copy multiple components in 
   different objects or a single object (mode editor/mode Playing), at the same time.
